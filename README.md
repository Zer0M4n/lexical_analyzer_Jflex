# lexical_analyzer_Jflex
This project is a lexical analyzer created with JFlex using NetBeans. It was developed for the subject "Lenguajes de Interfaz" during my 6th semester at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Tijuana. The analyzer reads text and splits it into tokens like keywords, numbers, and symbols to prepare it for further processing.
